Working with MCP Servers has a feeling of the early days of the internet, where first people created stand-alone websites, then linked to them, the made directories, until search engines indexed them all. 

Until now, we have been creating lists of MCP servers. GitHub MCP Registry may change this. Although the adoption challenge remains, as in every user has to configure their preferred MCP server individually. It isn't hard to imagine a feature scenario where agents can dynamically understand the prompt's intent, and discover and activate the appropriate MCP server. If you are interested, keep an eye on [developments in this space](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/registry).
