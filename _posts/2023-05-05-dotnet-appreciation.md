As you know, I am a big fan of openness:

* I want knowledge to be open, which is the essence of my work at [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/contribute/?wt.mc_id=pdebruin_content_blog_cnl_csasci),
* I want technology to be open, which is why I love the developments [here](https://opensource.microsoft.com/?wt.mc_id=pdebruin_content_blog_cnl_csasci),
* and I want to be free to choose tools that best [fit my needs](https://azure.microsoft.com/downloads/?wt.mc_id=pdebruin_content_blog_cnl_csasci).

In previous posts I used [Windows Subsystem on Linux and Windows Terminal](/accessing-azure-terminal/) to access Azure from any platform, that you can [run Linux on Surface](./ubuntu-on-surface-laptop-studio/), and that dotnet runs in [Linux containers](/dotnet-and-linux-and-containers/).

I don't talk a lot about dotnet, or powershell for that matter, because I think we should talk more about all other languages and their use on Azure. However, this week I saw a social media post of someone creating fear, uncertainty and doubt for using dotnet; that it is tight to "Microsoft", SQL, and license costs. This made me want to publicly appreciate dotnet, so here we go:
<ul>
<li> 
[Dotnet is opensource](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/open-source?wt.mc_id=pdebruin_content_blog_cnl_csasci)
</li><li>
[Download dotnet](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet?wt.mc_id=pdebruin_content_blog_cnl_csasci)
</li><li>
[Get started](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/learn/aspnet/hello-world-tutorial/intro?wt.mc_id=pdebruin_content_blog_cnl_csasci)
</li>
</ul>

This was different when dotnet started over 20 years ago, when it needed Visual Studio and Windows, both licensed products. Lots of things changed after that: [Visual Studio Community edition](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/?wt.mc_id=pdebruin_content_blog_cnl_csasci), [VS Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode?wt.mc_id=pdebruin_content_blog_cnl_csasci), [dotnet core](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-1-0/?wt.mc_id=pdebruin_content_blog_cnl_csasci), and making it [open source](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-core-is-open-source/?wt.mc_id=pdebruin_content_blog_cnl_csasci). Granted, we are still learning about dotnet and open source, so things are not perfect but this the way forward.

Mostly I create simple web apps and command-line apps, which you can with dotnet. It is a comfortable idea that dotnet is [fast and secure](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet?wt.mc_id=pdebruin_content_blog_cnl_csasci). And I think it is cool that you can create [webassembly](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor?wt.mc_id=pdebruin_content_blog_cnl_csasci), [minimal apis](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/minimal-apis/overview?wt.mc_id=pdebruin_content_blog_cnl_csasci), and [self-contained deployments](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#publish-self-contained?wt.mc_id=pdebruin_content_blog_cnl_csasci).

In short, dotnet has all ingredients to be the tool of choice in your next project :-)
