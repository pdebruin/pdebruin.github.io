Global AI Bootcamp is a great way to meet with like-minded people who are learning about AI either locally in-person or virtually online.

If you didn't get a chance to join a meeting, you can still take a look at the material:

15 minute [Agent Service introduction](https://github.com/microsoft/aitour-ai-agents-theater-session)

75 minute [Build your first agent workshop](https://github.com/microsoft/build-your-first-agent-with-azure-ai-agent-service-workshop)

And finally, check out the [AI agents for beginners](../ai-agents-for-beginners) course I mentioned earlier.

Thanks for reading! :-)
