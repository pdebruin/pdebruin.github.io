PyCon is happening this week. It is a [great conference](https://www.youtube.com/@PyConUS) and we have lots of interesting content too, incl presentations on debugger, cpython, dev environments, jupyrest, etc. 

As you may know, Azure is a great platform for any language, with compute options from serverless functions to kubernetes clusters, various AI services and data stores.

And there is more: a GitHub repository with lots of pointers to documentation, samples, blog posts, and videos.
