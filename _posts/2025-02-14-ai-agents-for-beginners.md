Artificial intelligence is generating lots of excitement, confusion, criticism, etc. For me, the best way to understand it is to learn about it. In that sense, [Learn and AI](https://learn.microsoft.com/ai?wt.mc_id=pdebruin_content_blog_cnl_csasci) is a great place to start. 

If you are specifically looking to get trained in a certain area, the latest trend is about agents, which go beyond retrievel augmented generation and chats, and are going to be able to perform actions. [AI Agents for Beginners](https://github.com/microsoft/ai-agents-for-beginners) is the latest in a series of for beginners courses that everybody should read
