This is a bit off topic when compared to AI or cloud technology. Recently, I read a article about expert generalists and it appealed to me. I have thought of myself as jack-of-all-trades before, and then people say master-of-none. But that is not really nice, and it isn't true. 

For instance, I am not a software engineer by profession, but I can write code to demonstrate or prove a concept. I am not a project manager either, but I can create plans and updates. I am not a solution architect anymore, but can still draw boxes and arrows, and actually think beyond that to discuss goals, requirements, and constraints. 

This was also an interesting angle: the article describes how an expert generalist works with specialists when deeper knowledge is needed. In return, the expert generalist provides the specialist with different perspectives to put their specialism in a different context, for instance to not create a random diagram but actually visualize a topic that product owners are trying to understand.
