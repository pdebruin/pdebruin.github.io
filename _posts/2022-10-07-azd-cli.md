DevOps Starter is a service that can help you get started with Azure very quickly: with just a few clicks you can select a programming language, and a compute service and DevOps Starter will set it in Azure DevOps or GitHub: A sample app in version control, with automated build and deployment to Azure. And after a couple of minutes your Java sample can be running on AKS, .NET on AppService, etc. Very useful for demonstration purposes, or learning about CI/CD or a new service.

The only thing missing was a command line option to do this.
