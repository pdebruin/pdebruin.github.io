The learning path takes you through all the Azure AI Services, including Vision, Language, Search, Document Intelligence, and OpenAI. 

If you haven't worked with these services yet, make sure to also practice with the exercices or separate samples. That will set you up for success. Good Luck!

Thanks for reading! :-)
