Recently I learned about three GitHub learning paths and certifications. Since one of them is on security, I decided to explore that one.

There are three collections available:
* GitHub Actions
* Github Advanced Security
* GitHub Administration

Check out [GitHub learning paths](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/github/).

As you can imagine, each prepares for the respective exam. [Exam information](https://examregistration.github.com) seems to be available for employees and partners. Even if you don't have access to the exam information, the learning paths are useful to learn about the content.GitHub Advanced Security is all about code, secrets, and dependencies and the learning path covers that very well. When you do pursue the exam, also check out the [code security docs](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security).
