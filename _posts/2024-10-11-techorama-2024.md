This week I helped the organization of Techorama Netherlands. The event was held on tuesday and wednesday in Utrecht. It was a fantastic place to meet engineers of all sorts. 

The venue was transformed into a fun fair, which was fun. As a consequence, the crew had to wear corresponding shirts, which... I probably wouldn't choose myself :-) 

The most popular presentations seems to be around .NET and C#. I was assigned to a room to help the speaker prepare and wrap up. In between, I could sneak in to other presentations by Bart de Smet (.NET), Clemens Vasters (Messaging), Thiago Almeida (Functions) and others.
