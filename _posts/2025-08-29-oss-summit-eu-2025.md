I attended Open Source Summit EU in Amsterdam this week, or actually I helped at the Microsoft booth one day. Apparently, Microsoft is involved in quite a number of [projects](https://opensource.microsoft.com/projects/)

It is always fascinating to see the number of projects that exist, and I have never heard of. And it is great to talk with people who live and work without software that I use every day. To be honest, I have tried to get involved in a couple of projects in the past, but I don't invest personal time and it doesn't help my job. Let's see what happens in the future. 

Anyway, for you the takeaway should be to go over projects and presentations to learn and get inspired.
