Sysinternals is a collection of tools, started ages by Mark Russinovich. One of the great tools for presenters is ZoomIt, a screen zoom, annotation, and recording tool for technical presentations and demos. Recently, it was updated and received a very interesting new feature called DemoType, which can automatically enter text, drastically automating your demos.
