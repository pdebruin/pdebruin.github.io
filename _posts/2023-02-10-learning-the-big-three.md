Technology trends come in waves. Sometimes they change something, and sometimes they just fade. Recently I have seen quite some discussion about various javascript frameworks. The challenge for the occasional user, like me, is before actually starting, you need to spend time to understand what is being used currently, what best fits your needs, and what has potential to still be relevant next year. My takeaway is that at least it never hurts to learn the basics of the web, starting with the big three: html, css and javascript. 

Learning html, css and javascript is offered by lots of organizations including w3c, mozilla, edx, etc.

By the way, there are many beginner series on various languages including rust, java, bash, python, f#, c#, node, etc.
