I like to experiment with technology. Recently I was wondering what it looks like to start to use Azure as a new customer nowadays. In another post I explained a bit about various ways to get started. This post describes my experience to start an Azure free trial.

For this, I am using an outlook account that I have created previously but haven't used in the context of Azure. So I can use it to start a one-off Azure trial.
