Once upon a time I was a Microsoft most valuable professional. At the time, I worked in a company that facilitated knowledge sharing and I worked with other experts in the community, so I didn't feel extremely special. Looking back, I think it is a great way to start working on your personal brand. 

The obvious disclaimer here should be that I work at Microsoft and you don't have to volunteer your time and energy for the company. You should do this primarily for you: What do you want to achieve? What do you want to do in the next couple of years? 

Working on your personal brand helps you. You start to become more visible within your own company, on platforms where you communicate like social media or forums, at meetups/events/conferences, etc. 

Start with the end in mind: what do you want to achieve? Is your goal in life to become MVP? Or do you want to use it as a means to something else? Make sure you work with a person to mentor you along the way. And let an existing MVP or Microsoft employee know about your plans, so they can help you in the nomination process. 

Note that you don't have to be an industry expert at the start. The more you put in the program, the more you will get out of it. And if you are a student, we also have a Student Ambassador program.
