At Ignite, [project Radius](../radius) was announced. This week Radius was accepted as CNCF sandbox project. 

In short: Radius is an open-source, cloud-native, application platform that enables developers and the operators that support them to define, deploy, and collaborate on cloud-native applications across public clouds and private infrastructure
