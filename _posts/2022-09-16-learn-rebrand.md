Microsoft Learn is the new home for all technical content, learning tools and resources. Documentation is still there https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/?wt.mc_id=pdebruin_content_blog_cnl_csasci. Learn modules and paths are now called training https://learn.microsoft.com/training/browse/?resource_type=learning%20path&expanded=azure&products=azure&wt.mc_id=pdebruin_content_blog_cnl_csasci. And architecture center is here too https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/?wt.mc_id=pdebruin_content_blog_cnl_csasci. Old links and bookmarks should work and redirect appropriately.
