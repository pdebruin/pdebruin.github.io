One year ago I restarted blogging. I was planning to experiment with content in various ways. This resulted in 40 (sometimes micro) blog posts, roughly one per week except for vacation or other busy Fridays. Creating video was much harder for me since that takes a lot of time to really create something useful. And then I would also improve the appearance, although my home office has been upgraded over the past three years, it is not up to studio standards yet.
