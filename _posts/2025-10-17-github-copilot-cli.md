GitHub Copilot in VS Code is used in most demos of Learn MCP Server, because it is our own and most popular MCP client. However, there are lots of other clients, and in the agentic development tools space specifically there are command line editors like Claude Code that are growing rapidly. Apparently there is an interest and I am happy to see GitHub Copilot CLI released.
