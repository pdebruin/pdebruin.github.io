This week I had the [opportunity to present](https://github.com/pdebruin/presentations/tree/main/Greece%20Cloud%20AI%20conference%202025) about [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com), and what we are working on. This is a fun way of structuring thoughts on (digital) paper and sharing ideas with others.
