# Ask me anything

In short: How can I help? 

Longer version: This is an experiment. Some time ago I read about how you tend to look at the world and see what you are not or do not have, which makes you sad. While in your life you have achieved things and looking back should make you feel good. Call it gratitude or thankfulness. And at this time you may be even thinking about a person who helped you or inspired you to get here. 

Aspects of the person you are today are likely ambitions for the future of somone else. Wouldn't it be great if you could help or inspire others to get where you are? Sounds good to me. This could include coaching, mentoring, resume review, where to start learning about cloud, etc.
